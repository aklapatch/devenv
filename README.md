## Portable devenv

This environment is designed to be used with scoop to facilitate tool updates and installations. It is also designed to be used on a flash drive, hopping from computer to computer E.g. a college campus or library.

### Notes
If you need a msys2 style terminal, you can call bash from the terminal made by scoopcmd.bat or use the bashcmd.bat file to use the git bash (in cmd) terminal.

The custom version of scoop.cmd needs to be installed in place of the scoop.cmd installed by the scoop installer. This version of scoop.cmd allows it to be used when drive letters change.
