# Portable Development Environment

This environment is designed to be used to facilitate tool updates and installations. It is also designed to be used on a flash drive, hopping from computer to computer E.g. a college campus or library.

## Notes
This environment uses a couple different tools. It uses [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and a custom powershell tool [here](https://github.com/aklapatch/devenv2.0). The powershell tool is intended to get new binary versions of tools that MSYS2 does not have or track (E.x. Rust, Julia, NodeJS, etc.) from websites where those tools are hosted.
